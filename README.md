# Geometry Rays Fyre
 Geometry Rays Fyre is the official rewrite of geometry rays.

 The geometry rays codebase is a mess and its like impossible to make it fullscreen.

 So in a desperate attempt to make the codebase better I'm just starting from the ground up.

 The name for the old geometry rays client is now Geometry Rays Legacy.

# Modding api
 Geometry rays provides an official lua modding api!
