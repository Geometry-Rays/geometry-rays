# Geometry Rays Fyre
 Geometry Rays Fyre is the official rewrite of geometry rays.

 The geometry rays codebase is a mess and its like impossible to make it fullscreen.

 So in a desperate attempt to make the codebase better I'm just starting from the ground up.

 The name for the old geometry rays client is now Geometry Rays Legacy.

 For now it will still be supported but it won't get new features and will only have bug fixes and minor improvements.

 Eventually once this has all the features of legacy the old client will stop being updated entirely and you will have to move to fyre.

# Modding api
 Geometry rays fyre provides an official lua modding api!
