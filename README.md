# State of Development
 I (Puppet) have resigned as lead dev of georays.
 
 I have just lost most of my motivation for working on georays and I have started moving on to new projects.

 Lncvrt has commit access so he will be taking over development.

 I'm not saying I won't come back but I'm not saying I will.

 I don't know how much lncvrt is going to work on georays if at all.
